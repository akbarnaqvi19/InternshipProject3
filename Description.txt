Project 3:

The project aims to develop an algorithm for image identification

The Digital Recognizer dataset is used which is a version of the MNIST Dataset

The Data Visualization code checks for how uniform the dataset is 

Preprocessing is done to accurately train the classifier

A KNN classifier is then trained to classify images based on their pixel data

TensorFlow/Keras Approach:
	Although TensorFlow/Keras are used to create neural networks 
	They can be used to act like an KNN classifier
	The optimal value of K was found to be 1
	But this approach leads to very  low accuracy
	The whole model could not be saved and only the values of Best K and Accuracy were saved in a (.pkl) file

SkLearn Approach(Alternative):
	Implementation of a KNN model through SkLearn proved to be more effective
	The accuracy of the model was checked for different values of K
	The Accuracy was plotted with the K values
	K=20 showed the highest accuracy
	Model trained with highest accuracy was saved as a (.pkl) file
